    description: A Helm chart for creating a Grafana dashboard, backed by a Postgres
      database. The output of the Ookla Speedtest.net CLI tool writes to the database.  The
      intention of this deployment is to create a simple Internet Health Check Dashboard.  This
      Docker image was build with the intended host being a Raspberry PI 4, but there
      is no reason why it cannot run anywhere else. It is compatible with 32-bit systems.
